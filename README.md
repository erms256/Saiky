<h1>Project Name: Saiky</h1>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Saiky is a program developed for data retrieval and sorting for training the "Gentrification CNN Prototype" neural network. Its main function is to extract data from Shape-file format files and process them to make requests to the Google Maps API and obtain satellite images. This program has been developed in Java and uses the GeoTools library and the Google Maps API to carry out these tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Programming Language: Java</li>
<li>Libraries/Frameworks:
  <ul>
    <li>GeoTools: Used for geospatial data manipulation, including extraction of data from Shape-file format files.</li>
    <li>Google Maps API: Used for making requests and obtaining satellite images for specific areas.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Functionality:</strong> Saiky automates the process of extracting geospatial data from Shape-file format files and requesting satellite images through the Google Maps API. These satellite images are then used as input data for training the "Gentrification CNN Prototype" neural network. The program provides an interface to specify areas of interest and request parameters, and then handles the process of requesting and sorting data for use in neural network training.</p>
